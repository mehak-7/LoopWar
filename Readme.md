## 🗃️ Database Usage

The project uses a backend database to manage:
- 🔸 User authentication (for login/joining rooms)  
- 🔸 Room creation & room access control (ID + password)  
- 🔸 Problem assignment for each room  
- 🔸 Real-time code syncing and collaboration  
- 🔸 Submission tracking (time, status, score)  

The database is structured to handle both **real-time updates** and **persistent storage**, ensuring:
- ⚡ Fast performance during active games  
- 📜 Reliable results/history tracking post-match

## 📌 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Code Editor:** Monaco Editor or similar  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express (or Serverless functions)  
- **Database:** Real-time + auth-supported DB (Firebase, Supabase, or MongoDB with WebSockets)  
- **Real-Time Sync:** WebSockets / Firebase Realtime Database
